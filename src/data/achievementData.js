    bio : "In my career, I’ve achieved significant milestones, Over the years, I’ve led and contributed to several impactful projects across global teams. At Discover Financial Services, I optimized JVM memory and CPU usage, improving application performance under high transaction loads. I successfully migrated legacy systems to modern microservices, reducing load times by over 30% through frontend performance tuning. My work in deploying containerized applications on AWS EKS and automating CI/CD pipelines helped reduce release cycles by 50%. I’ve also mentored junior developers, led Agile ceremonies, and played a key role in achieving over 90% test coverage across major modules. Participating in internal hackathons, I’ve proposed scalable architecture solutions that were later adopted in production.",
